# Email-Notify Scripts

Written on my Raspberry Pi Zero W, because of it's ability to stay on consistently with low power usage the script is able to send email's out every night at 12:00 AM.

## Open Source Notification System

Send's the user notification's through email.

### System-Notify.py

This script will notify user's about internet status, weather details, system's info, etc.
